Lives for 120 days.

8µm x 8µm x 2µm.

High membrane-to-cytoplasm ratio allows it to change its shape and squeeze through narrow paths.

Inflexible RBCs fail to squeeze through the splenic slits and are phagocytosed by macrophages.

Lacks mitochondria and the cytosol is reducing, where Fe+++ is reduced to Fe++.

ABO antigens are carbohydrates and Rh antigens are proteins.
They develop by few months old.
Under normal circumstances, an antigen and its antibody do not coexist.

People with blood type O have RBC lacking both A and B antigens and have anti-RBC A and B, so they are universal RBC donors.

People with blood type AB have RBCs with both A and B antigens and lack antibodies against them, so they are universal plasma donors.

Direct antiglobulin test mixes a person's things with its own things.
Indirect antiglobulin test mixes a person's things with testing things.

Forward typing is an indirect typing to test a patient's RBC.
Reverse typing is in indirect typing to test patient's antibodies.

Anti-D is an IgG against Rh and can cross placenta.
