## Summary

Bacterial influenza.

## Name

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

Commensal in the nasal cavity.
Gram-!
Rod.

Encapsulated (a, b, c, d, e, and f) = typable.

Epiglottitis (25%, followed by parainfluenza virus, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Streptococcus pyogenes).
Immediate hospitalization.

Unencapsulated = nontypable because of lack of capsule.
Less invasive.
Inflammatory response.
Otitis media, conjunctivitis, sinusitis.

### Enter

Opportunistic.

Trimeric autotransporter adhesins (Gram-) to adhere.

### Colonize

Culture requires special ingradients.

### Persist

IgAse.

B lactamase and modified penincillin binding protein.

Transformation, which helps spread recA gene that helps surviving oxidative stress.

### Replicate

### Exit

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

### Detect

### Deploy

### Eliminate

### Remember

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Typical pneumonia.
Otitis.
Mastoiditis!
Cellulitis.
Jagular thrombophlebitis.
Central nervous system infection.

Upper to lower tract.

Sinusitis and acute otitis media (33-66% Streptococcus penumonia, 20% this, 5% Staphylococcus aureus)

### Diagnosis

Culture from sterile sites.
Grow in the a hemolytic zone of Staphylococcus aureus.
Catalase positive and oxidase positive.

### Therapy

B lactams (amoxicillin and ceftriaxone).
3rd generation cephalosporin.

### Prevention

Hib vaccine works against capsulated only.
Expensive; 42% in developing countries and 8% in least developed countries.

### Epidemiology

Only human.

Infants and young children.

Discovered during 1892 influenza pandemic.

1st free-living organism to have its genome sequenced by Craig Venter team.
