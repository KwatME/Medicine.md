## Summary

## Name

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

Co-evolved with human.

### Enter

Can't trasmit from poop.
Lacks environmental reservoir.
Transmits from an infected person closely to another one orally.

### Colonize

Flagella.
Infects only stomach pylorus; won't invade deeper.
Stays near mucus cells, whose mucus protects from the H+.

### Persist

Supresses HCl secretion.
Urease converts urea into HCO3- and NH4+ to neutralize H+.
Less immunogenic.
Membranes mimic host patterns and are less immunogenic.

CagA gene, found in the pathogenic island, codes for a syringe that inserts into a host cell and stimulates proliferation.
VacA gene codes for a protein that steals nutrients from a host cell using vacules.

### Replicate

Slow.

### Exit

Vomit.

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

### Detect

### Deploy
