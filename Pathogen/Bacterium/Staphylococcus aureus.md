## Summary

## Name

Staphylococcus means grape like.
Aureus means golden.

B (with a toxi) or g hemolytic.

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

Gram+.
Commensal (30% regular, 2% MRSA) in upper respiratory tract, skin, loewr reproductive tract of women.
Facultative anaerobe.
Nonmotile.
20% genome is dynamic, undergoes horizontal gene transfer by bacteriophage and other ways.
There is methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.

Heterogeneous; heterogeneous simultaneous infection.

Polymorphism in glucocorticoid receptor is associated with commensal inhabitaiton.

### Enter

### Colonize

The golden color is from the carotenoid pigmnet, which resists oxidation.
Bubbles in a catalase test.
Forms abcess with neutrophils.

Bronchiectasis

### Persist

Attaches to peptidoglycan (commonly found on implants), which is part of collagen, fibrinogen, and elastin.
Coagulase activates fibrinogen into fibrin, resulting in thrombi around the bacteria to wall immune cells.
Protein A binds to the antibody FC regions to inhibit phagocytosis.
Capsule biofilm walls immune cells.
Carotenoid pigment is antioxidant.

Hyaluronidase breaks down hyaluronic acid.
Deoxyribonuclease.

Toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 binds nonspecifically with T cell receptors and activate them, resulting in sepsis.
Exofoliative toxin breaks epidermis.

Penicillnase.
Methicillin is penicillnase resistant.
But.
Mecithillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus has mecA gene that makes PBP2a, which bind less with b lactams.

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Skin: pimples, impetigo, boils, carbuncles, cellulitis, folliculitis, scaled skin syndrome, and abscess.

Common in atopic dermatitis (exzema).

Respiratory tract: sinusitis, pneumonia

Systemic (high fatality rate): meningitis, (common cause of) endocarditis, toxic shock syndrome, bacteremia, and sepsis.

MSK: (most common cause of) osteomyelitis, septic arthritis

Implant infection.

Toxin causes food poisoning.

Biofilm is coinhabited with Candida albicans.

### Diagnosis

Blood and stool culture.

Catalase positive (all Staphylococcus).
1930s coagulase; (Staphylococcu aureus)
DNAse.

### Therapy

Nafcillin is a b lactam, which disrupts transpeptidase, which builds peptidoglycans.
Vancomycin disrupts cross linking peptidoglycans.
Vancomycin is more effective against MRSA because their transpeptidase binds poorly with b lactams.

Reserch: bacteriophage.

### Prevention

Monitor infections associated with implants.
No vaccine.
