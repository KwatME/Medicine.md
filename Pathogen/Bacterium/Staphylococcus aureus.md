Staphylococcus means grapes.
Aureus means golden.

It is a Gram+ bacteria that lives on the skins, upper respiratory tract, and lower reproductive tract of 30% of people.
Methicillin resistant type lives in 2% of people.

20% of its genome is dynamic, being transferred by bacteriophages and other mechanisms to others.
So, each bacterium is vastly different from another and a population heterogeneous.
Heterogeneous individuals simultaneously infect and cause diseases.

It can not travel, but can attach to peptidoglycan, which is common in collagen, fibrinogen, and elastin.

It walls itself with biofilm.
The biofilm often contains fungus Candida albicans.
It also has coagulase, which activates fibrinogen into fibrin to form thrombotic walls.

It can make energy by oxidation or fermentation.

It forms an abcess with neutrophils.
Its golden color is from the carotenoid pigmnet, which resists oxidation. 
Its catalaze disables oxidizing H2O2 into H2O and O2.
Its protein A binds to the antibody FC regions to inhibit opsonization.

Its toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 nonspecifically binds to the T cells and activates immune cells.
Overreactive immune system results in an inadequate immunity against it. 

Its exofoliative toxin breaks epidermis to help spreading.
Its hyaluronidase breaks down hyaluronic acid found in connective tissues.
Its staphylokinase completely lyses red blood cells (making it being classified as a B hemolytic microbe).
Its DNAse breaks down the neutrophil DNA traps.

It has glucocorticoid receptors.

Its diagnosed by blood or stool culture.
Its culture should be Gram+, grape like, catalase+, coagulase+, and DNAse+.

It is used to be treated with simpler cell wall inhibitors (B lactams) such as penicillin, which inhibits PBP.
But some acquired penicillnase, which inactivates penicillin.

Penicillnase-resistant cell walla inhibitors like nafcillin were developed and are used today.

But then B lactam resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) emerged.
MRSA has mecA gene that makes PBP2a, which binds less with B lactams.
Methicillin is a B lactam used to test for this resistance.
For treating MRSA, vancomycin, which disrupts D-Alanine-D-Alanine crosslinking in the cell wall synthesis, is used.

However, recently, some acquired the ability to crosslink with D-Alanine-D-Lactate, which escapes binding to vancomycin.

Bacteriophages against it are being devleoped.

There is no vaccine.
Implants should be monitored for infection.
