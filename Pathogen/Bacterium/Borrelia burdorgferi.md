## Summary

Tick borne corkscrew bacteria that causes local and systemic symptoms, Lyme disease.

## Name

Borrel is the scientist who studied spirochaetes.
Burgdorfer is the scientist who isolated the bacteria in 1982.

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

Belongs to Spirochaetes, which are gram-, corkscrews shaped, and have internal flagella.
The internal flagella rotate the body, like corkscrew.
Microaerophile.
Replicates slowly.
Other notorious Spirochaetes include Leptospira and Treponema.

### Enter

Reserviors are predominantly white footed mice and deer.
Heavy bodied and black legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) prey on the reservior hosts and get infected.
(Young tick prefers the mice, which is more accessible and has thinner skin.)
Infected tick bites a human and transmits the infection.
When a tick bites, it continuously numbs the local area with its saliva and sucks the blood for days.
Borrelia within the tick's stomach senses the blood, replicates, and migrates to the salivary gland, and together with the saliva, flows into the human.
Sensing the blood to entering the human takes two to three days.

### Colonize

Lives inbetween the human cells.
Replicates slowly and spreads by drilling with its corkscrew powered by the flagella, resulting in bull's eye or erythema migrans rash.
Spreads to and colonizes places with less immune cells, including the nervous system, heart, joints, and muscles.

### Persist

Frequently alters its outer membrane protein, Osp, to avoid being recognized by the immune system.
Disrupts cells.
Attaches to extracellular matrix.
Supresses immune cells and complement system.

### Replicate

Slow, doubling every 24 to 48 hours.

### Exit

No need to exit from the human because human is the dead end host.

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

Avoiding the areas with reservior hosts and the vector.
Removing tick without squeezing it.
Antibodies from a previous Borrelia infection.

### Detect

The membrane protein Osp and the flagellum are immunogenic.

### Deploy

Macrophages eat them.
Complement proteins attack and tag them.
Plasma cells make antibodies against them.
The complement tags and the antibodies enhance macrophage phagocytosis.

### Eliminate

Phagocytosis eliminates them.
Some can hide in areas with less immune cells.

### Remember

Antibodies persist for a long time and help fend off any future infection.

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Causes Lyme disease, which has three stages.

The early localized stage happens 3 to 30 days aftr the inoculation.
The site of the tick bite develops bull's eye or erythema rash.
Constitutional symptoms follows.

The early disseminated stage presents weeks to months later.
There can be multiple rashes, neurologic symptoms including lymphocytic meningitis and cranial nerve (typically VII) palsies, and cardiac symptoms including atrioventricular block and myocarditis.

The late stage can present months to year later.
There can be arthritis of large joints, encephalomyelitis, polyneuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, and neuropsychiatric sequelae.

After a successful treatment, post-Lyme disease syndrome can present with non-specific symptoms including headache and fatigue.

Ticks carry other pathogens.
10% coinfection, which is synergistic and causes severer symptoms.

### Diagnosis

The early localized stage relies on clinical diagnosis.
The early disseminated stage requires 2 stage tests: ELISA of whole bacterial lysate and, if positive, serology of IgM (if symptoms occured within 30 days) and IgG.
The late stage can use PCR of cerebrospinal or synovial fluid as as a confirmatory test.

Antibody tests have low sensitivity in the early localized stage.
Due to cross reactivity, IgM tests have false positive rate of 20-50%.
IgG lasts for decades.

Even in the endemic areas, less than half of the suspected patients have active Lyme disease.
Test only if there are objective evidences supporting a high pretest probability.

View using dark field microscopy.

### Therapy

B lactam disrupts the cell wall production.
Tetracyclines and macrolides disrupt ribosomes.

For the early localized stage, amoxicillin and doxycycline are typically used in children and adults, respectively. 
For after the early disseminated stage, ceftriaxone is also used.

### Prevention

Avoid infested areas.
Wear protective clothes.
Use tick repellants.
Remove ticks early without squeezing.
Bath after any potential exposure.

### Epidemiology

The most common vector-borne infection in the US.
Also found in Europe and Asia.
Northeastern coastal states are endemic.
