## Feature

Gram+.
Rod.
Anarobe, which commonly disseminate as spores.
Spores show up less stained in a Gram staining.
Spores are in poop.
Bleach can kill the spores.
Alcohol is not effective at breaking the spores.
Non-toxic strains are commenal.

Spores live in the environment.
Asymptomatic carriers (small number of people) can be reserviors.

Strains that secrete toxins cause symptoms.

Spores transmit via any medical items; wash hands.

## Life

Fecal-oral transmission.
Bile activates the spores in the intestine.

Gastric acid kills them.
People on antibiotics or gastric acid suppression are suceptible to infection.

Colonize gastrointestinal if the commensal microbes are weak.

Toxin A activates neutrophil and toxin B is more potent, both degrade epithelial cells.

Toxin PCR, but positive result without symptoms do not need treatment.

Degrading epithelial cells, immune cells, and debris form plaques.

Disrupt tight junctions.

Risk factors:
- Antibiotics
- Hospitalization
- Elderly
- Severe illness
- Gastric acid suppression
- Chemotherapy

## Medicine

Fecal toxin antigen test.

Treat with oral vancomycin.
Fecal transplant high high cure rate in refractory cases.

Younger patient, oral metronidazole.
Older patient, oral vancomycin.

Asymptomatic patients do not need treatment.
