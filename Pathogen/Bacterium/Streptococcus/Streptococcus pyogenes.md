## Summary

## Name

Streptos means chain (this one has longer chain than Streptococcus pneumonia).
Coccos means berry.
Pyo means pus.
Genes means making.

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

Streptococcus species are classified based on hemolytic properties.

Hemolytic A can convert Fe2+ to Fe3+, breaking hemoglobin into biliverdin; green colony on agar (Streptococcus pneumoniae and oral commensals).
Hemolytic B uses streptolysin t odestroy red blood cells; clear area on agar.
Hemolytic G causes no hemolysis.

Hemolytic B is further classified by Lancefield (due to capsular glyco molecules).
Streptococcus pyogenes is the group A Streptococcus.
Gram+.
Diplococcus.

Most streptococci are oxidase-negative and catalase-negative, and many are facultative anaerobes (capable of growth both aerobically and anaerobically).
Oxidase test checks if a bacteria produces cytochrome c oxidases which enables using of O2 for energy production.


### Enter

### Colonize

Nasopharynx.
Mucosal associated lymphoid tissue.
Gastrointestinal tract and lower female genital tract.
Oropharynx.
Tonsils.
Genital mucosa.
Rectum.
Lives extracellularly.
Attaches with pili.

Like lymphatic tissues including Walldeyer's Ring.

Nasopharynx has good ventilation and blood and less anaerobic competitors.

This remarkable microbe could provide a Master class to other bacteria on how to evade host complement deposition and activation, impede phagocyte recruitment and activation, resist killing by host antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, escape the DNA nets thrown out by neutrophils, and kill phagocytic host cells by punching holes in their cytoplasmic membrane.

### Persist

Makes a lot of weapons.

M protein (most important virulence factor) inhibits the complement system and thus phagocytosis; autoimmunity; 100 types; binds factor H on the surface of the bacteria and fibrinogen, which repels C3b.
C5 peptidase; determines type specific immunity.

Capsule made of hyaluronate, which mimics the hyaluronate in the connective tissues; also antiphagocytic; determines virulence; hyaluronate binds to CD44 on epithelial cells; CD44 is for intercellular bridging; CD44 increases after injury.
Lipoteichoic acid, resists antimicrobial peptdes and neutrophil killing.

Erythrogenic toxins including streptolysin O (O2 inactivates it) damages the red blood cells and white blood cells.

Streptolysin O: responsible for b hemolysis; sends in NADase via the pore; oxygen killed hemolytic exotoxin; works with NADase; resist phagosome acidification and NADase moves from the phagolysosome to cytosol and destroys NAD and depletes energies; toxic to various cell types including myocardium.
Streptolysin S: oxygen not-killed lytic exotoxin againt broad targets including erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, and organalles including lysocomes and mitochondria.

Streptococcal pyrogenic exotocin A and C: encoded by bacteriophage; superantigens ==> nonspecifically activate immune cells; rash, scarlet fever, nectotizing fasciitis, ~toxic shock syndrome.
Streptococcal pyrogenic exotocin B: degrade extracellular matrix, cytokines, compliment proteins, antibodies.

Hyaluronidase degrades hyaluronic acid in connective tissue.
DNAase.
Streptokinase activates plasmin, which breaks thrombus; used as thrombolytic therapeutic.

### Replicate

Single axis replication results in a chain.

### Exit

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

Antibody against M protein.
Antibody mediated phagocytosis.
M protein mimics host protein, and the antibodies can be autoimmune.

Antibody against streptolysin O.

### Detect

### Deploy

Antibody agaisnt M protein

### Eliminate

### Remember

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Red strawberry tongue.

Scattered petechiae.

Elderly and childrne.

60% of bacterial pneumonia and 11% of pneumonia.

Fever.

Pharyngitis.
Cough.

Infrequent in flora.
Skin and soft tissue infections.
Erysipelas.
Erytheminis.
Cellulitis.
Necrotizing fasciitis.
Folliculitis.
Impetigo (Staphylococcus is more likely).

Specific toxin causes Scarlet fever, which is associated with pharyngitis and symptoms including fever and diffuse erythematous rash beginning on the face (strawberry tongue) and the trunk.

The cutaneous infections are much more associated with the Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, which has the mortality over 50%.
The symptoms can include hypotension, liver failure, and acute respiratory distress.

If (likely pharyngeal infection) untreated, 10 to 20 years after the infection, acute rheumatic fever can happen.
Autoimmune from the the M protein antibody.
Common in age 5-15.
Cardiac (pancarditis, pericardial friction, Aschoff body made of multinucleated giant cells in all layers), central nervous system (Sydenham chorea from the antibody effect on the basal ganglia), skin, joints (smaller joints affected first).

After one to two weeks of the infection (often pharyngitis), autoantibodies can cause temporary glomerulonephritis commonly in kids.

Streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat)
Impetigo
Scarlet fever

Toxic shock syndrome
Necrotizing fasciitis
Pneumonia
Bacteremia

Untreated ==> Rheumatic fever (joints, kidneys, heart valves)
Glomerulonephritis (more common after skin infection)

### Diagnosis

Viral features should be absent: rhinorrhea, cough, oral olcer, horseness.

In children, negative rapid antigen detection test (specific but not sensitive) should be confirmed by throat culture.

Many serotypes.

Diagnose acute rheumatic fever based on the Jones criteria: two major criteria or one major criteria wiht two minor criteria.
Major criteria: pancarditis, polyarthritis, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, and Syndenham chorea.
Minor criteria: ECG heart block, arthralgia, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C reactive protein, fever, leukocytosis, and history of rheumatic fever.

Beta-hemolysis, a complete destruction of red blood cells.

Staphylococci are catalase positive whereas streptococci are catalase-negative.
Catalaze converts H2O2 into H2O and O2.
Catalaze breaks down H2O2, protecting an organism from oxidative stress.

Rapid strep test or culture

Strep throad 5-15 years old.

Viral pharyngitis is still most common.
Viral sympts include: cough ,rihorra, horseness, oral ulcers, conjucticits.

Throad culture rapid antigen detection test is a gold stanfrd dtst.

### Therapy

Penicillin, amoxicillin,

Surgery.

### Prevention

### Epidemiology

Acute rheumatic fever is rare in developed countries. 
In developing countries, it is the most common cause of a chronic heart disease (rheumatic heart disease).
Joint symptoms in over 50%.
Syndenham chorea in 30%.

In non-US, throat to rhuematic heart disease is the most common heart disease cause.
