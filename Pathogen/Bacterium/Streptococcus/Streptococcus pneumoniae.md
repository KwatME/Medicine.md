## Summary

## Name

Strepto means chain.
Pneumonia means lung inflammation.

DNA experiment.

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

Gram+.
Spherical.
Diplococcus (PAIR) or short chain.
Facultative anaerobe.
Nonmotle.

A hemolytic; Streptococcus pygenes is b hemolytic.

vs. Haemophilus influenza.
Both use neutrophils to attach the other.

Lacks Lancefield surface antigens.

Has lipoteichoic acid.

### Enter

### Colonize

Transparent phase in the nose.
Opaque phase in the blood, with more polysaccharide and capsular expression.

Commensal in the upper respiratory track.

Require choline.

### Persist

Capsule, which inhibits the complement system, is the major virulence factor.
IgAse.

Pneumolysin fomrs pore.

Synergize after influenza virus infection.

### Replicate

Transformation of DNA; under stress.
DNA damage repair.
Oxidative burst in granulocytes.

### Exit

Droplet.
Children transmit frequently.

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

### Detect

### Deploy

### Eliminate

### Remember

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Becomes pathogenic in people with weaker immunity, including children and elderly. 

Single acute rigor.

Typical pneumonia, which is community acquired.
Meningitis.
Sepsis.
Pneumococcal infection (sinus travel).

### Diagnosis

Clinical and culture form anywhere.

### Therapy

Outpatient healthy: macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin) or doxycycline.
Outpatient co-morbidities: fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, lenofloxacin) or or b lactam (amoxicillin) plus macrolide.

### Prevention

Scheduled vaccine.
CDC recommends routine pneumococcal vaccination for all children aged <2 years and older adults aged ≥65 years.
Prevnar 13 which contains thirteen serotypes of pneumococcus which are conjugated to diphtheria carrier protein
A 23 valent vaccine has been released.

Ones with capsule types not included in the vaccine are increasing.

Cochlear implant is a risk factor.

### Epidemiology

Seasonal.

The most common (2/3) bacterial pneumonia.
Most common cause of pneumonia leading to hospitalization.

Bacteremia occurs in up to 25–30% of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia.

Most common cause of bacterial meningitis, bacteremia, otitis media, sinusitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, peritonitis, endocarditis.

Pneumococci cause over 50% of all cases of bacterial meningitis.
The case-fatality rate of pneumococcal meningitis is about 8% among children and 22% among adults.
Neurologic sequelae are common among survivors.

Pneumococci are a common cause of acute otitis media, causing up to 20% of those infections.
Persons with a cochlear implant appear to be at increased risk of pneumococcal meningitis.

The overall case-fatality rate for bacteremia is about 20% but may be as high as 60% among elderly patients.

Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
