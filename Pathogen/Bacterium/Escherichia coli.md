Named after pediatrician Escherich and colon.

Gram- rod.
Commensal in the gastrointestinal tract.
Horizontal gene transfer.
Lipopolysaccharide.

Exfoliating toxin.
B lactamase.

Intestianl and extraintestinal presentation.

Fecal-oral transmission.

## Enterotoxigenic:

From plasmid, got pili and 2 toxins that leak Cl- out of the cell from the CFTR.
Labile toxin (LT) is similr to cholera AB toxin.
Stable toxin (ST) is a small peptide; heat denatures it but it refolds when cooling and remain toxic.

With rotavirus, causes most of the diarrheal illness in children.

Traveler's diarrhea.

Affects the proximal small intestine.

## Enteropathogenic:

Pili.
Pathogenicity island codes for type 3 secretion system, which inserts into a enterocyte to create a channel.
Through the channel, proteins move into the cell and remodel the cytoplasm to build a docking site and damage the tight junction.

Common in infants.

Affects the proximal small intestine.

## Shiga-toxigenic:

Commensal in cows.

Bacteriophage infected animal enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and gave it the gene for Shiga toxin, an AB toxin like in Vibrio cholera.
Shiga toxin can be injected using the type 3 secretion system.

Incubates for 2-5 days.
Shiga toxin shuts down ribosome, causes apoptosis, and aggregates platelets causing inflammation and local ischemia.
Watery diarrhea becomes bloody diarrhea.
Shiga toxin can spread systemically and cause hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Self limited.
Supportive care until the toxin fades away.
Antibiotics can be harmful because stressing the bacteria signals the bacteriophage genome to make more virus and exit the bacteria.
Making more bacteriophage results in making more shiga toxin, which is part of the bacteriophage genome.

Source is contaminated food.

Abdominal Pain

Thrombocytopenia

Thrombotic Microangiopathy

Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
(5-10% develops)

Acute Kidney Failure

## Uro-pathogenic:

Gastrointestinal to urinary tract infection.
More common in females because of their shorter urethra.
Urinary flow clears them.
Anatomic abnormalities and sexual intercourse (honeymoon cystitis) are risk factors.

Pili (fimbria) attach to the urinary tract epithelial cells.

Attachment results in getting inside the cell.

Replicates intracellularly and rapidly, bulging and bursting the infected cell.
Some may hide intracellularly and dormantly and result in a recurrent infection.

Urinary tract abnormalities are risk fasctors for recurrent infection.

Structural abnormalities are risk fasctors for recurrent infectionl

Seminal tract infection is possible too.

Neutrophils come and infected cells come off.
Urine analysis: hazy (cells and debris), blood (inflammation), nitrite (bacteria metabolite), leukocyte esterase (while blood cell especially neutrophil protein), white blood cells, and bacteria.
Periurethral flora can infect the meauring instrument and cause false positive (asymptomatic bacteriuria).

Empirical treatment (only if symptomatic):
- Amoxicillin (old practice)
- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (increasing resistance)
- Nitrofurantoin
- Phosphomycin
- Ciprofloxacin (increasing resistance) 
- B lactams
