Named after pediatrician Escherich and colon.

Gram- rod.
Commensal in the gastrointestinal tract.
Horizontal gene transfer.
Lipopolysaccharide.

Exfoliating toxin.
B lactamase.

Intestianl and extraintestinal presentation.

Fecal-oral transmission.

## Enterotoxic:

Has Vibrio cholera's AB toxin

Traveler's diarrhea

## Enteropathogenic:

Needle inserts into a enterocyte and remodels the cytoplasm and damages the tight junction.

## Shiga-toxigenic:

Cow feces

Shiga toxin (not related to shigella), which causes systemic disese including hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Antibiotics stress them and they release more shiga toxin.

## Uro-pathogenic:

Gastrointestinal to urinary tract infection.
More common in females because of their shorter urethra.
Urinary flow clears them.
Anatomic abnormalities and sexual intercourse (honeymoon cystitis) are risk factors.

Pili (fimbria) attach to the urinary tract epithelial cells.

Attachment results in getting inside the cell.

Replicates intracellularly and rapidly, bulging and bursting the infected cell.
Some may hide intracellularly and dormantly and result in a recurrent infection.

Urinary tract abnormalities are risk fasctors for recurrent infection.

Structural abnormalities are risk fasctors for recurrent infectionl

Seminal tract infection is possible too.

Neutrophils come and infected cells come off.
Urine analysis: hazy (cells and debris), blood (inflammation), nitrite (bacteria metabolite), leukocyte esterase (while blood cell especially neutrophil protein), white blood cells, and bacteria.

Empirical treatment:
- Amoxicillin (old practice)
- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (increasing resistance)
- Nitrofurantoin
- Phosphomycin
- Ciprofloxacin (increasing resistance) 
- B lactams
