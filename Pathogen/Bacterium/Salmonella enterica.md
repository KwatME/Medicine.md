Gram-.
Lipopolysaccharide.
Flagella.

Typhi and Paratyphi are human specific (fecal oral) and cause systemic disease.
Non-typhi are transmitted from animals commonly reptiles, chickens(eggs are the most common source) and causes enteritis.
Salmonella strain that is specific to chichen causes bacteremia in chicken and be inside an egg.
Cook egg.

Transmission from young reptiles.
In the US, distribution of turtles smaller than 4 inches is banned since 1975.

Many types of processed food are contaminated from for example mice.

Stomach acid kills it.
Ones reached ileum and colon compete with the microbiome, for example for Fe.

1 type 3 secretion system reprograms the M cell, dendritic cell, and enterocytes to engulf it, Salmonella splash.
It remain in the vacule and uses another type 3 secretion system to grow the vacule and bring things into it.
Some molecules can leak into the cytosol and results in inflammation.
Spreads basolaterally.
Inflammation is beneficial to it because it weakens the microbiome.

Antibiotics use and gastric acid suppression increase the suceptability.
Antibiotics are not usually not indicated (results in more reinfection in older children) unless for infants, immunosuppressed, cancer patients, transplant patients, and sickle cell patients to protect systemic spread.
Need multiple negative stool culture (black culture) to be negative.
