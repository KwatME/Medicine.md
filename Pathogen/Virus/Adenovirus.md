## Name

Adeno refers to the adenoid glands.

## Feature

dsDNA genome in a capsid.

Capsid has fiber protein, which competitively binds to the receptors that seal the tight junction, distupting tight junctions.

Only adenoviridae that infects human.
50+ serotypes.

## Life

Commensal in the tonsil and the adenoid glands.

Replicates in the nucleus.

2 broken viral dsDNA genomes can combine and rescue each other.

Commonly infect:
- Nasopharynx
- Oropharynx
- Larynx
- Bronchus
- Bronchiole

Can spread deeper than epithelium, by exiting in the basal surface and by disrupting the tight junctions, and infect all tissues, such as hepatitis.

Fecal-oral transmission.

## Epidemiology

Rare respiratory virus that does not have seasonality.
