## Summary

## Name

Infected cells fuse and become syncytia, which is a multi nucleated cell.

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

Enveloped RNA.
Faimily includes parainfluenza virus and metapneumo virus.
Lives in nasal epithelium.

-ssRNA.

Antigenic subtype A (16) and B (22) based on surface protein F and G.

Non segmented genome so there is no reassortment and no pandemic.

Envelop.

Variable shapes including filamentous. 

### Enter

Gets to the lower respiratory tract, binds to a G protein, and enters the cell.
Infects dendritic cell and then T cell.

### Colonize

Bronchus.
Bronchiole.

T cell.

Phylum Nagarnaviricota.
(Ebola, rabies, and influenza.)
Descendant of dsDNA virus (reovirus).
All linear genome.
-ssRNA genomed ones often have envelop and genome is segmented.

-ssRNA ==> N +ssRNA
-ssRNA ==> 1 +ssRNA ==> --ssRNA

Highly contageous (5-25 people)
Live 25min on skin and hours on surfaces.
Contagious up to 4 weeks.

Infected cell slough down the airway.

### Persist

G protein attachs to the respiratory epithelial cells.
F protein fuses infected cells, resulting in multinucleated cell.

Secreted versions of the proteins decoy the antibodies.

### Replicate

### Exit

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

Antibodies against the G and F proteins.

### Detect

### Deploy

### Eliminate

### Remember

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Reinfection is common.
Common cold in adults and more serious ones in elderly and immunocompromised. 

Conjunctivitis.

Bronchitis.

Croup.

Bronchiolitis (causes 70% of this).

Pneumonia.

Low grade fever.

Reinfection is similar to sinus infection and common cold.
20% progress to lower respiratory tract infection.

Immunocompromised and people with cardiovascular disease.

### Diagnosis

One serotype.

### Therapy

Ribavirin is the only approved antiviral for treating children.

### Prevention

No vaccine.
Prophylactic is palivizumab (intramuscular), which inhibits F protein.
Recommended for:
- Infants born 28 weeks or before and younger than 12 months at the start of RSV season
- Infants with chronic lung disease younger than 12 months at the start of RSV season
- Infants with congenital heart disease younger than 12 months at the start of RSV season
Considered for infants with:
- Congenital airway abnormalities
- Neuromuscular disorders
- Cystic fibrosis
- Immunocompormise
- Recent or upcoming Heart transplant

### Epidemiology

Children get it by 2 years old.

Leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and children under 5.
