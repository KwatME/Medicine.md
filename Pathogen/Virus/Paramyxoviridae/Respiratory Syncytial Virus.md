In vitro, infected cells fuse and become syncytia, which are multi nucleated cell.

Paramyxoviridae features.
Variable shapes including filamentous. 

Lives in nasal epithelium, bronchus, and bronchioles.

Slough down the airway, plug small airway, dyspnea.

Antigenic subtype A (16) and B (22) based on surface protein F and G.

G protein attachs to the respiratory epithelial cells.
F protein fuses.

Antibodies against the G and F proteins.
G protein is heavily glycosylated, feature that interferes with antibody production.
Secreted versions of the proteins decoy the antibodies.
Immunity against RSV is incomplete and shortlived.

Infects dendritic cell and then T cell.
Infects dendritic cells to reduce antigen presentation.

-ssRNA ==> N +ssRNA
-ssRNA ==> 1 +ssRNA ==> --ssRNA

Highly contageous (5-25 people)
Live 25min on skin and hours on surfaces.
Contagious up to 4 weeks.


Reinfection is common.
Common cold in adults and more serious ones in elderly and immunocompromised. 

One serotype.

Infants, children, elderly, immunocompromised people, or people with chronic diseases.
Children get it by 2 years old.
Leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and children under 5.

No vaccine.

Prophylactic with palivizumab, which inhibits F protein.

Recommended for:
- Infants born 28 weeks or before and younger than 12 months at the start of RSV season
- Infants with chronic lung disease younger than 12 months at the start of RSV season
- Infants with congenital heart disease younger than 12 months at the start of RSV season

Considered for infants with:
- Congenital airway abnormalities
- Neuromuscular disorders
- Cystic fibrosis
- Immunocompormise
- Recent or upcoming Heart transplant

Ribavirin is the only approved antiviral for treating children.
