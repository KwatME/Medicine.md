## Summary

## Name

Human parainfluenza virus [1-4].

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

-ssRNA (carry viral RNA polymerase).
Enveloped.

Human specific.

4 major serotypes: considered as separate viruses; type 1 is more in croup.

Buds out from the apical surface, without killing the cell.
Less viremia.
Increases replication, mucus cells, debris, and swelling down to trachea entrance (Steeple sign in children).

Family Paramyxoviridae.
Not related to influenza virus but with respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus.
Mumps and Measles.

### Enter

Reinfection is common because it buds from the apical surface.

### Colonize

Stays few hours in the environmnt.

Trachea.
Bronchus.
Alveolus (common).

### Persist

Hemagglutinin-neuraminidase.
Hemagglutinin clumps red blood cells.

Most efficient in terms of replication and transcription have genome nucleotide total that is divisible by the number 6.

### Replicate

### Exit

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

### Detect

### Deploy

Antibody.

### Eliminate

### Remember

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Pharyngitis.
Sore throat.
Laryngitis.
Hoarseness.

Pneumonia.

Laryngotracheobronchitis.
Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) (problem in children youner than 2 years of age).

Bronchitis.

### Diagnosis

Culture.
ELIZA.
PCR.
IgG.

Infected cell has larger cytoplasm.

### Therapy

Corticosteroid and nebulizer for croup.

### Prevention

No vaccine.

### Epidemiology

Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus are the #1 and #2 cause of respiratory hospitalization in children under 5 years old.
