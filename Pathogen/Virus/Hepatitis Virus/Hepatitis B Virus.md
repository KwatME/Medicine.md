## Summary

## Name

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

dsDNA that is covalently closed and circular.
The viral capsid crawls on the microtubule to the nucleus.
Human immunodecifiency virus also crawls on the microtubule to reach the nucleus.
Doesn't integrate but codes for mRNAs for viral proteins.
The mRNAs also reverse transcribes to dsDNA.
The newly made proteins and the dsDNA assemble new viruses, which exit without harming the host cell.

### Enter

### Colonize

During the acute infection, it secretes protein E to stress the immune system.

### Persist

### Replicate

### Exit

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

### Detect

### Deploy

### Eliminate

### Remember
Antibodies againt the surface, protein E, and the core are present.
Only the anti-surface is protective.

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Acute and chronic hepatitis.
Hepatocellualr carcinoma.

### Diagnosis

Surface antigen is present for four weeks.
Surface antigen antibody is present after 32 weeks.

Protein E antigen is present during the acute infection.

Core antigen is present during the acute phase, but it can't be measured.
Core antigen antibody is IgM for six weeks and switches to IgG in 36 weeks.
IgM is present at low level in a chronic infection.

### Therapy

### Prevention

Surface antigen vaccine.

### Epidemiology

Maternal vertical transmission.
Infects 1/3 population.
