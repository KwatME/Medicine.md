Happens around a macrophage.

In a newbron, breathing brings in more O2 and this increase in O2 slows down erythropoiesis.
10 days the after birth, [Erythroblast] reaches the maximum and results in a physiologic anemia.
In response, EPO increases and restimulates erythropoiesis.

When [Hemoglobin] drops below 8, a normal marrow response elevates [Reticulocyte] above 8, which indicates [Absolute Reticulocyte] to be above 150K.

Without erythropoiesis, [Hg] decreases 1mg/week.
If it declines faster, bleeding or hemolysis may be happening.
