-azole.

Inhibits Erg11, disrupting the synthesis of ergosterol, cholesterol equivalent in fungi.

Mammalian cells don't have Erg11, so there is no direct toxicity.

There are indirect toxiciites: prolongs the cardiac repolarization and lengthens the QT interval; inhibits cytochrome p450 and stressing the liver.

Anti-yeast (systemic and mucosal Candida, Cryptococcus meningitis induction):
- Fluconazole (intravenous or oral; Candida albicans; some candida are resistant; Cryptococcus neoformans)

Anti-yeast-mold (when giving orally, monitor absorption; yeast Aspergillosis, endemic fungi):
- Voriconazole (best for pulmonary aspergilosis)
- Posaconazole
